# Flight_Booking_project

The GitHub repository for the flight booking project is a comprehensive codebase for a web application designed to enable users to book flights. The project has been developed using several technologies including HTML, CSS, Tailwind, JavaScript, and Django. It includes several features that make it a complete solution for a flight booking application.

The repository contains various folders and files that are used to build the application. The frontend code is located in the "static" and "templates" folders, while the backend code is located in the "views" and "models" folders.

The project features a user authentication system that allows users to register, login, and logout. Users can create an account using their email address and password. Once registered, they can log in to the application to access their account and view their booking history.

The search flight feature allows users to search for available flights by entering the source and destination cities, the departure and return dates, and the number of passengers. The system retrieves all the matching flights from the database and displays them on the search results page.

Users can book a flight by selecting the desired flight from the search results page and entering their personal and payment details. After booking a ticket, users receive a confirmation email containing the ticket details.

The system also includes a PDF generation feature that allows users to generate a PDF ticket for their booking. The PDF contains all the details of the booking, including the passenger's name, flight details, and payment information.

Admin users can update the flight details by logging in to the administration panel provided by Django. They can modify the flight schedule, add or remove flights, and update the ticket prices.

Overall, the GitHub repository for the flight booking project provides a complete solution for a web-based flight booking application with several features such as user authentication, flight search, booking, PDF generation, and flight management. It's well-structured, modular, and easy to understand, making it an excellent starting point for developers looking to build similar projects
